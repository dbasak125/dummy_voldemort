# dummy_voldemort
A Voldemort like distributed Key-Value store with replication and fault-tolerance built in

<p1>Update: Completed the basic distributed system modeling in TLA+ specification language. I am checking the safety property of the system by defining an Invariant function over the TLA+ specification, and confirming the behaviour with various counts of Read Quorum, Write Quorum and FAILNODES.</p1>
<p2>Will keep this space updated with latest developments regarding the actual implementation code and feature additions.</p1>
